Not a lot of major changes - mostly minor fixes and adjustments. The biggest change is that the version has changed from 0.9 to 1.0.  This is largely because we seem to have reached a "stable" point with Suneido and it has proven itself in several production settings.  However, like most version 1.0 software, this does not mean it's "finished". (Is software ever "finished"?)  We will, of course, continue to develop and improve Suneido.

Some of the more significant changes for this release:

- temporary database indexes now use a separate memory area
- objects now compare lexicographically i.e. #(1,1) < #(1,2) < #(2,1)
- added string.Iter i.e. foreach (char in string)
- new string, number, and object methods (in stdlib)
- numerous additions to the documentation (largely thanks to Kim Dong)

Compatibility

- string.CountOccurences has been renamed to string.Count
- object.Iterator has been renamed to object.Iter
