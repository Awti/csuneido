Suneido April 7, 2003 Release (1.0.030407)

This is a fairly minor release - mostly small bug fixes and minor IDE improvements.

Some of the more significant changes for this release:

- a small start on some refactoring tools (Library View > Refactor)
- ImageControl & OpenImageControl improvements (keep proportions, link or embed)
- a number of improvements to the Go To Definition feature in the IDE
- added Revert, Undelete, and Locations to Library View
- the Suneido C++ source code now compiles with GCC 3.2
- the FAQ, License, and Cookbook are now included in the User's Manual

Compatibility

- DataController has been removed and should be replaced by Controller
- ImageControl & OpenImageControl require slightly different arguments
- Scanner.Next was changed to be compatible with other iterators
- several bugs were fixed that could (rarely) cause previously working code to break
