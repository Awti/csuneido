Suneido October 22, 2001 Release

The most visible change this time is probably support for folding in
Scintilla.  If you don't like it (e.g. on the WorkSpace) you can turn
it off from the right click context menu.  Scintilla has also been 
updated to the latest version 1.40.

No major changes in the executable.  Some work on the documentation.  
Lots of small bug fixes and changes to stdlib.  The new language 
translation support is included in this release along with data for
Spanish, Italian, French, German, Russian, and Czech. (Note: You still 
have to load the translation data in order to use it.)

NOTE: The Run key has changed from F2 to F9, since F2 has other
standard meanings.

NOTE: TextFile is gone, please use File instead.

NOTE: string.Strip has been renamed to string.Trim

The other significant addition this time is automatic version checking.
When WorkSpace starts up it spawns vercheck.exe which reads a file
called version.txt from the Suneido web site and compares it to your
current version (if you're connected to the Internet).  If there's a
newer version available it'll let you know.  Vercheck is a generic 
utility - see source/vercheck/vercheck.txt  The reason for this addition 
is that we're finding a lot of people running out of date versions of 
Suneido that they've downloaded from other sites.  If you don't like 
this, you can simple delete vercheck.exe or comment out the call from 
WorkSpace.  NOTE: vercheck is read-only, it does not send any information.

Enjoy!
