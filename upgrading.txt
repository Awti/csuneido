Upgrading Suneido with a New Release

All the code and data that you create with Suneido is in the database -
suneido.db. The installer download handles updating an existing database.
However, the zip file download includes a new database. If your old
database contains anything you want to keep you don't want to install a
new release over your existing one. There are several ways you can handle
the upgrade, I'll just describe one of them.

Note: If you use the setup / installer version of the download, it handles 
this process automatically - just install over your previous version.

Of course, it's always a good idea to make backups, just in case!

1. Dump any tables you want to keep from your old database.
   For example:

    C:\suneido> suneido -dump applib
    C:\suneido> suneido -dump appbook

2. Rename your database, just in case you need it back:

    C:\suneido> ren suneido.db suneido.bak

3. Unzip the new release into your existing Suneido directory.

4. Load your tables into the new database.
   For example:

    C:\suneido> suneido -load applib
    C:\suneido> suneido -load appbook

Note: If you are on Windows 9x, you'll find that you are returned back to
the MSDOS prompt immediately after a dump or load command, before the
command is complete. If you try to run another command right away, you'll
get an error saying the database is in use. To avoid this you can prefix
the dump and load lines with "start/w", for example:

    start/w suneido -load applib
