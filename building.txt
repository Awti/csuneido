Building Suneido

Suneido is normally built with the free
Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 
for Windows Desktop
using the included Solution and Project files
(Note: VS 2013 = VC 12 i.e. year != version)

It is also possible to build with MinGW, although
the Internet Explorer interface (SuneidoAPP)
which is used by "Books" is not supported.

Assuming standard configurations,
use one of the following batch files:

mingw_debug.bat
mingw_release.bat

The title bar on your Command Prompt window
should change accordingly.

You can then build using GNU make.

Suneido uses the Boehm-Demers-Weiser 
garbage collector.

A precompiled gc.lib is supplied, to build it
yourself use make in the gc directory 
after running one of the above batch files.

Note: The setup batch files *add* to the path,
to switch to a different configuration,
start a new command prompt window.
