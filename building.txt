Building Suneido

The supplied executable is built with the free
Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 Toolkit.
(no longer available)

Suneido can also be built with the free
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.
You will also require the
Windows® Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK 

It is also possible to build with MinGW, although
the Internet Explorer interface (SuneidoAPP)
which is used by "Books" is not supported.

Assuming standard configurations,
use one of the following batch files:

mingw_debug.bat
mingw_release.bat
vc7_debug.bat
vc7_release.bat
vc8_debug.bat
vc8_release.bat

The title bar on your Command Prompt window
should change accordingly.

You can then build using GNU make.

Suneido uses the Boehm-Demers-Weiser 
garbage collector.

A precompiled gc.lib is supplied, to build it
yourself use make in the gc directory 
after running one of the above batch files.

Note: The setup batch files add to the path,
to switch to a different configuration,
start a new command prompt window.
