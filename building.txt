Building Suneido

Suneido is normally built with the free
Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
using the included Solution and Project files

It is also possible to build with MinGW, although
the Internet Explorer interface (SuneidoAPP)
which is used by "Books" is not supported.

Suneido uses the Boehm-Demers-Weiser 
garbage collector.
