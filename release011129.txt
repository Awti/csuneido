Suneido Nov. 29, 2001 Release

Lots of small changes, a few bug fixes. Some of the more significant 
improvements include:

dll interface 
- improved support for int64
- added float and double

network sockets
- added timeouts
- improved readline performance
- fixed speed conflict with Nagle algorithm

Thanks to Helmut Enck-Radena, Jeremy Cowgar, and Roberto Artigas Jr. 
for their contributions to this release. And thanks, as always, to 
the Suneido crew - Jeff, Tracy, and Jennie.

Compatibility Issues With Previous Release

- QuickSort (stdlib) has been replaced by additional functionality in 
object.Sort (built-in)

- The leading character for hiding columns in ListView (and therefore 
IdControl and KeyControl) has changed from underscore (_) to dash (-). 
However, in most cases it is no longer necessary to hide columns in 
IdControl and KeyControl since they now automatically include 
(and hide) the required column.
